# AR Foundation in Unity


## A simple Android AR project. 

I used this hack-a-thing to learn how to develop AR for Android phones. A simple cube should appear on a table once the project is run on an Android phone.

## Lessons learnt
I learnt how to set AR Foundation and set up a simple AR scene in Unity 3D. AR Foundation is used for the development of AR apps both for android and iOS but I set up this project for Android. This allows easily changing platform of developed applications between iOS and Android without changing the scripts of the application. Great way that allows "build[ing] once deploy[ing] everywhere."
